# Discrete-Math
# Sorting Algorithms Case Study

This project demonstrates different sorting algorithms applied to sorting student results in descending order.  
It helps to understand how Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort work, including their time complexities and use cases for different dataset sizes.

## Installation

1. Make sure to install latest version like Python 3.x on your computer.  
2. Install the colorama and pep8 for colored and formatted version of code for this run below commonds on terminal:

#### pip install colorama
#### pip install pep8

## Usage
Download or clone this project to your computer.
Open terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Run the main program on terminal with command:
#### python main1.py

### Read the instructions when program runs it will navigate what to do 
1. Tells which algorithm is best for which lenght of data set 
2. Whether to use data from a file or generate automatically
3. The type of dataset (sorted, reverse sorted, random)
4. The sorting algorithm to apply you want to apply
5. The sorted data is save in file name sorted_marks_.txt

## Dependencies
 Python3.x latest version
 coloroma
